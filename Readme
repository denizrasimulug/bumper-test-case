The Django project is contained in 'bumperguest' folder, with a single app inside it called 'guestbook'.

Refer to Makefile files for relevant commands.

You can find the integration tests and the load test inside the tests folder.

I also wanted to expand the case by automizing the load test data creation part, and dropped two manage.py commands inside the guest book app. But later I could not figure out a proper way (ie. fast and readable) to build the test data on sql-lite, so the next step would be to properly switch to postgres for the load-testing.
