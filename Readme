The Django project is contained in 'bumperguest' folder, with a single app inside it called 'guestbook'.

Refer to Makefile for relevant commands.

You can find the integration tests and the load test inside the tests folder.

INTEGRATION TESTING

The integration tests run on an sqllite db, you can run them as follows:

# make test

LOAD TESTING

For load testing, we use the postgresql. You can spin up an instance and run the tests by doing:

# make run_postgre
# make loadtest


EXPLANATION OF SOLUTION

To solve the user data query problem, I introduced a new field into the entry model, "ulid". 

ULID is an uuid standart, where it embeds the timestamp of its creation time in the first bytes of the data, then a random part later; so that it is both sortable and globally unique. It is both a timestamp and an id.

Without this field, I would have either used an inefficient subquery solution, or have to first get the latest creation times for each guest, then use the creation time itself as an identifier to get the entry data. We of course would not want to use the creation time as an id, but with ulid, we can.

Here are the comparisons of the loadtest for both the subquery solution and the ulid solution:

User Count: 100
Entry Per User: 10000
Subquery: 8.3 seconds
ULID: 0.3 seconds

User Count: 10000
Entry Per User: 5
Subquery: 50.4 seconds
ULID: 0.2 seconds
